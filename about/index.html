<br>
<p>Hello, I am Chad &lsquo;Piffey&rsquo; Anderson, a security researcher and photographer living and working in Seattle, Washington. Currently, I work at <a href="https://domaintools.com">DomainTools</a> on the research and development team.
<br>
<br>
My cybersecurity work involves the analysis and creation of infrastructure data sets used in the distillation of data into threat intelligence for analysts and researchers around the world. I enjoy writing automation and tooling to further the success of security and research teams looking to analyze cybercriminal groups and nation state threat actors. With a background steeped in DevOps, I find the crisp automation of infrastructure as code and the use of cloud native architectures to be a theme through what I create and am influenced into researching. Lastly, I also enjoy work in the offensive security space and malware reverse engineering as I feel both greatly inform all of the other work.
<br>
<br>
My photographic practice can best be aligned with the tradition of American street photography where I explore our modern daily social life mostly in the city of Seattle. I strongly feel that this public visual language is essential to documenting the pinnacle changes of our time in a timeless, honest way. Curiosity and a humorous outlook on the world around me drives my attempts to represent what I see in a beautiful, meaningful way I can share. I work with traditional methods in my Seattle darkroom where I develop my own negatives and create silver gelatin prints.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, I enjoy writing on many topics and that is a lot of what you will see on this site coupled with a way to show my photographs. Previously, I kept all of these things in disparate places, but decided that as they all influence each other in my life I would like them to be combined in a single space.
