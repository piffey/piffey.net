      <description>In my photographic practice I tend to be much more interested in why a photograph is impactful due to its content or what makes the photograph more beautiful than the scene that was photographed.

I try to determine locations based on the sun and shadows, distant ridge lines, the positioning of satellite dishes, and anything else that can give me a clue.</description>
